# GRSIConfCodes

Codes for setting up the TIGRESS/GRIFFIN DAQ systems

Original author: S. Gillespie

Revisions (Oct 2020 - present): J. Williams

## Running

Requires GRSISort to be installed, with the `$GRSISYS` environment variable configured.

Instructions on how to use these codes are on the [GRSI wiki](https://grsi.wiki.triumf.ca/index.php/Stephens_page_of_things) or [here](doc/stephens_page_of_things.pdf).

## Dev history

These codes were originally developed by S. Gillespie as part of his postdoctoral work.  This repository collects the various DAQ setup and calibration codes in a single location, and may host future updates to the codes.  For now, it is recommended to use the original versions (specified here: https://grsi.wiki.triumf.ca/index.php/Stephens_page_of_things) unless you *really* know what you're doing.
